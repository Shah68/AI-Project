# AI-Project
A project using AI to build Tic Tac Toe game.

The project is to build a Tic Tac Toe game with Minimax Algorithm. Tic Tac Toe is basically a 3x3 grid game where two symbols are used which are X and O. As the game begins it will randomly assigns the player and the computer (AI agent) which sysmbols they will use to play the game.

4. Animated Match Display:- This feature works when anyone of the player wins the game, when the player wins the game an imaginary line will connect the combination of sysmbols highlightning the pair of winning symbols.
5. Turn Indication:- In the side panel of the game below the scores, a brown box will hover on the symbol indicating whose turn is there either the player or the AI agent.
6. Draw Handling:- If the game is over and player want to start a new game then this feature will clean the board.
